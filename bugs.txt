FIXED: More framerate vs. time fixes.

FIXED: Baiters fired based on framerate instead of time.

FIXED: Guppies didn't face left when traveling that way.
 
FIXED: Player ship would not teleport through stargate facing 
highest abuducting lander if player was carrying humans.

FIXED: Firebomber Showdown mission had dynamos spawning only at the 
top of the arena.

Some update (tick) handlers (e.g. CEnemy::Move variants) may still process 
things by frame count instead of by time, causing incorrect timing 
on frame rates other than 60 fps.

FIXED: View widgets do not activate/deactivate correctly, causing check assertions to fail. 
  Code architecture changed. All sprite installs/uninstalls also done in 
  main widget, not play arena view.

Firebombers shoot too frequently as XP increases.
