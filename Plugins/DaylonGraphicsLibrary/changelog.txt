Changelog for DaylonGraphicsLibrary UE plugin

Last updated: August 27, 2023

Changed Daylon::GetWidgetPosition to fix bug where 
it wasn't quite returning the widget's layout position.

Added Tint member to SDaylonSprite, lets sprites
be tinted by an FLinearColor.

Added FRange class to make min/max ranges easier to handle.

Added operator-- and operator++ overloads for TBindableValue.

Added bReversible property to FDaylonSpriteAtlas, to 
support texture animations that can be looped in a 
forward-then-backwards-then-forwards-etc. manner, 
simplifying texture creation and reducing texture size.
The scavenger atlas, e.g. is reversible.

Added IsStatic member to SDaylonSprite, to let calls 
to Update be ignored so that upstream code can still 
have Update being called but manage the current cel explicitly.

Added FlipHorizontal and FlipVertical members to SDaylonSprite, 
which swap the UV region of OnPaint's quad box accordingly.
This is useful when e.g. a change in game object direction 
need only flip its texture.

Added ClearSlot method to PlayObject2D and made Uninstall() 
call it to ensure that uninstalled widgets had no slot pointer.

Renamed Daylon::PlayObject2D::Spawn to Daylon::PlayObject2D::Start.
"Start" means to just start using an already created and spawned widget.

Renamed Daylon::CreateXxxPlayObject2D to Daylon::SpawnXxxPlayObject2D.
"Spawn" now has a specific meaning: to create a widget _and_ install it into the widget tree.

Moved functions from UDaylonUtils class to the Daylon namespace, since they 
weren't using any BlueprintCallable tags. The class name is reserved 
in case we want to add BP-callable functions later.

Renamed DoesTriangleIntersectTriangle to DoTrianglesIntersect.
