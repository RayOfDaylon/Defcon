Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DaylonGraphicsLibrary provides common routines and data types (classes)
useful for 2D Unreal Engine games. It's used e.g. by the SpaceRox game, 
an Atari Asteroids clone.


UDaylonUtils
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a blueprint function library (although no functions are blueprint callable)
reserved for any functions that need to be BlueprintCallable.


Daylon namespace
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This namespace contains data types (other than UObject-based classes which cannot reside 
within a namespace).

SetWidgetTree    Call this early to establish the WidgetTree to use when 
                 constructing widgets.

SetRootCanvas    Call this early to establish which UCanvasPanel widget
                 to use when adding a widget to your scene. Normally, this 
                 will be the top-level widget immediately below the 
                 UUserWidget that was added to the UE viewport.

MakeWidget       Call this to construct a UWidget of the desired type. 

Show/Hide        Shows or hides the specified UWidget/SWidget.

UpdateRoundedReadout  Efficiently updates a text widget with an integer value
                      derived from a rounded floating-point number.

AngleToVector2D  Converts an angle (in degrees) to a unit vector. 
                 Angle zero corresponds to a vector of [0, -1] and 
                 increasing angles proceed clockwise.

RandVector2D     Returns a random unit 2D vector.

Rotate           Rotates a 2D point around a given angle (in degrees).
                 The pivot point is the origin (0, 0).

DeviateVector    Randomly perturbs a vector by an angular range.

Vector2DToAngle  Converts a 2D vector to an angle, in degrees.
                 A vector of [0, -y] corresponds to zero degrees, 
                 a vector of [+x, 0] corresponds to ninety degrees, etc.

WrapAngle        Modulates a degree value to be within the 0-360 range.

GetWidgetPosition       Returns a UWidget's position in Slate units (not screen space pixels).
                        This is handy if you need to position something else related to a widget and need 
                        to use Slate units (because on different displays the pixel units will differ).
                        Note: widgets in motion may report values off by a frame.

GetWidgetSize           Returns a UWidget's size in Slate units.

ComputeFiringSolution   Given a launch point, a projectile speed, a target point
                        and a target inertia, returns the projectile inertia that will 
                        make it intersect the target.

RandomPtWithinBox       Given an FBox2d, returns an FVector2D that is a random 
                        point within it.

GetWidgetDirectionVector    Returns the unit direction vector for a widget's rotation.
                            The rotation is encoded in the widget's render transform.

DoesLineSegmentIntersectCircle      Returns true if a line intersects a circle.

DoesLineSegmentIntersectTriangle    Returns true if a line intersects a triangle.

DoTrianglesIntersect                Returns true if two triangles intersect.

DoCirclesIntersect                  Returns true if two circles overlap.

EListNavigationDirection      Enum constants for list navigation.

TBindableValue                Template class that binds a delegate to a variable.
                              When the variable changes, the delegate is called.

FLoopedSound                  A simple class that plays a sound over and over 
                              as long as its Tick method is called.

FScheduledTask                A class that executes a function at some specified 
                              number of seconds into the future.

FDurationTask                 A class that executes a function every time 
                              Tick is called for a finite number of seconds, 
                              and then calls an optional completion function.

FHighScore                    A single entry in a high score table.

FHighScoreTable               A simple high score table.

PlayObject2D                  Template class implementing most 2D game object functionality.
                              You should use a specific subclass such as ImagePlayObject2D though.

ImagePlayObject2D             A PlayObject2D that uses an SImage widget. Suitable
                              for game objects that have a static appearance.

SpritePlayObject2D            A PlayObject2D that uses an SDaylonSpriteWidget.
                              Good for game objects that have a dynamic appearance.
                              The Steller Mayhem powerups e.g. use this class.

PlayObjectsIntersectBox       Returns true if an array of PlayObject2D widgets
                              intersects a given 2D rectangle.

FRand                         Returns a random real number inclusively between 0.0 and 1.0.

RandBool                      Returns a random true/false value.

RandRange                     Returns a random integer inclusively between two integers.

FRandRange                    Returns a random real number inclusively between two reals.

UMG widgets have been retired to an #if 0 ... #endif block. 
The code is retained there for reference.


SDaylonSpriteWidget
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This SWidget renders a picture that can change over time. It contains an 
FDaylonSpriteAtlas member that defines a texture atlas and frame rate.
It's assumed that the cels (tiles) inside the atlas fill it out with an 
equal number of pixels per cel.

Call the Update() method to animate the picture.

If you are using the atlas to occasionally change the appearance of 
the widget, call the SetCurrentCel() method instead.


FAnimSpriteCel
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A gameplay object that holds a static brush but can animate its quad from one 
size and position to another. Used by the intro to make the game title 
letters emerge one-by-one from the center of the screen.


SDaylonParticlesWidget
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This SWidget draws particles moving away randomly from the widget's center.
Steller Mayhem e.g. uses it for all of its explosions.

Call the Update() method to advance the animation. If it returns false, 
the animation has ended and the widget can be disposed or hidden.

Call the Reset method to set the animation for another replay.


SDaylonLineParticlesWidget
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to SDaylonParticlesWidget, but uses a provided array of line segments.
Used by the miniboss explosion to show the shield segments blowing apart.
