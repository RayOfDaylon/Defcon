The background stars pan at half the speed of the 
foreground objects e.g. terrain. The Yllabian dogfight 
missions lack terrain so flying can seem slow, but 
it's what the original arcade game does.

Entering the stargate before mission end and without any 
human abductions in progress moves player ship to the 
other side of the planet (apparently this is what the 
original arcade game did -- the only way to teleport 
randomly was to use the Hyperspace button).

Laser beams use texture atlas that give disintegrating tail 
effect similar to arcade game.

Started work on invincibility powerup.

Removed all .cpp code related to unused IGameObject::GetClassname method.

Renamed PlayViewBase::FindHuman to FindNearestHuman.

Dropped explicit Const versions of some methods.

Renamed IGameObject::Move to Tick.

Play arena places the humans, and with a new "humans placed" flag 
in game instance, randomizes their x-positions on the first mission 
of a new game session.

Converted min/max pref vars to range vars, using the new 
Daylon::FRange type and its supporting global functions.

All arguments to IGameObject::Move should now be 'DeltaTime'.

Added secondary explosion texture atlas, 
makes enemy destruction more entertaining.

All military missions now use AddEnemySpawnInfo instead of 
having big, mostly duplicate code in MakeTargets.

Pressing Esc in the play arena transitions to mission picker 
instead of to main menu.

Renamed all references to tasks to use "task" nomenclature, 
including the name of the "event" code modules. "Event" 
is to mean notifications e.g. input events.

Mission class has a separate task list for enemy creation tasks, 
to make it easier for Mission::IsComplete to tell when 
no targets are pending creation.

Sprite uninstallation checks if widget is still valid, to prevent 
errors logged by Daylon::Uninstall. This happens when 
transitioning away from the play arena.

Started moving away from the "hostiles remaining" concept 
in CMilitaryMission, in favor of the more reliable 
checking of the current wave index and actually counting 
the current enemies list to see if any mission-critical 
targets remain.

Renamed HostilesRemaining to TargetsRemaining.

All mission classes have to define the MaxWaves member.

Renamed CEvent to CScheduledTask and CEventQueue to 
CScheduledTaskList.

Moved gamename.dat resource file to inline C++ code to avoid 
problem with packaged builds not including that "asset".

Several old preference items removed.

Lander descent/ascent rate ranged and grow faster with XP.
Lander appearance vertical range increased to upper half of arena.

Smart bomb resupply XP increased to 20,000.

Player ship input handling directly updates its 
navigation control state instead of using an 
intermediate state array; UpdatePlayerShipInputs removed.

ILiveGameObject's motion physics changed to use 
explicit duration instead of computed from current game time.
GameTime() function commented out since we shouldn't use it.

ExplodeObject renamed to DestroyObject; explosion 
is a boolean parameter.

Game object processor marks objects as dead and calls 
their OnAboutToDie method instead of each object class 
doing it in their Explode() method.

Most Explode() method code now uses AddExplosionDebris().

Intro screen moved company name to center, then fades it out
as title collapses around it.

Player ship's max thrust preference increased to make 
speed closer to the arcade version.

Global replace of 'int' with 'int32'.

Code cleanup of mapper classes.
