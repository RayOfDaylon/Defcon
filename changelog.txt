ExplodeObject renamed to DestroyObject; explosion 
is a boolean parameter.

Game object processor marks objects as dead and calls 
their OnAboutToDie method instead of each object class 
doing it in their Explode() method.

Most Explode() method code now uses AddExplosionDebris().

Intro screen moved company name to center, then fades it out
as title collapses around it.

Player ship's max thrust preference increased to make 
speed closer to the arcade version.

Global replace of 'int' with 'int32'.

Code cleanup of mapper classes.
